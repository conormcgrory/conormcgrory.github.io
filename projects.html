  <h2>Princeton Undergraduate Thesis: <em>Sampling Strategies for Bayesian Optimization</em></h2>

  <p>For my undergraduate thesis at Princeton, I worked on generalizing Bayesian optimization (an
  algorithm used to optimize noisy, black-box functions) to scenarios where the amount of noise
  added to observations of the objective function varies across the domain. This project was advised
  by <a href="https://pillowlab.princeton.edu">Prof. Jonathan Pillow</a>, and I continued working 
  on it in his lab for the summer after graduating.

  <p>You can read my thesis <a href="files/princeton_thesis.pdf">here</a>.

  <h2>REU Project: <em>Sentence Simplification for Question Generation</em></h2>

  <p>During an REU fellowship at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) in 2014, I
  worked with <a href="http://www.cs.uccs.edu/~jkalita">Prof. Jugal Kalita</a> and 
  <a href="http://cs.uccs.edu/~linclab/faltarou">Feras Al Tarouti</a> on developing a method for
  automatically generating simple comprehension questions from natural language sentences. This work
  was presented at the <em>International Conference on Computing and Communication Systems</em> at 
  North Eastern Hill University, Shillong, Meghalaya, India, in April 2015.
